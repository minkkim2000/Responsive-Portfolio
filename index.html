            Born and raised never described the same place for Me. I was born in Seoul Korea, spent my childhood in Boston and New York, went to middle and high school in Seoul, San Diego, then Seattle for college. The year I turned 23 I finally moved to Los Angeles, where I currently reside.
            <br>
            In the summer of 2013, I graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle with a double major in Fine Arts with a focus in Painting and Drawing and in Comparitive Literature with a focus in Cinema Studies. 
            <br>
			I like to eat. I like to drive long distances. I like to build gundams. I used to slay in Pokemon Red Version. I probably still do if I could only find my Gameboy charger... If I was really rich, I would love to learn how to drive like Vin Diesel from Fast and Furious. Some favorite directors of mine are Darren Aronofsky, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Quentin Tarauntino, Danny Leiner, and 20st century Disney movies.
			<br>
			Bojack Horseman is a good show to watch as well as Mr Robot and Halt and Catch Fire, Damages, How to Make it in America, Bored to Death, Archer, and so the list goes. Ask me if you need a movie or show to watch.
